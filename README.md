# Project Timeline & Milestones

   * ## Design Phase (GP5)

    **Deliverable:** **Thursday,** **January** **21,** **2021**
    In this phase we will work together to brainstorm and formulate a high level account of the 
    functionality of our website.  During this phase we will complete the following primary goals:
    * Develop a test plan that will verify that our website meets project requirements
    * Create a website story-board (a series of images/drawings that illustrate how the users   
      will interact with the website)
    * Create a website prototype
    * Research some core rules and principles of good graphic design (color, spacing, animations) 
      and explicitly commit to following them.
    * Decide what technologies to employ(PHP, MYSQL, WordPress, Node.js) 
    * Make explicit decisions regarding how to document the software
