This repository contains the projects that I completed in my Internet Applications Development course at Whitworth University in January of 2021.

# Project Timeline & Milestones

   * ## Design Phase (GP5)

    Deliverable: Thursday, January 21, 2021

    In this phase we will work together to brainstorm and formulate a high level account of the 
    functionality of our website.  During this phase we will complete the following primary goals:
       * Develop a test plan that will verify that our website meets project requirements
       * Create a website story-board (a series of images/drawings that illustrate how the    
         users will interact with the website)
       * Create a website prototype
       * Research some core rules and principles of good graphic design (color, spacing 
         animations) and explicitly commit to following them.
       * Decide what technologies to employ(PHP, MYSQL, WordPress, Node.js) 
       * Make explicit decisions regarding how to document the software

   * ## Implementation Phase (GP6)
  
    Deliverable: Monday, January 25, 2021

    In this phase we take the design that we drafted in phase 1 and we flesh it out.  Using the
    technologies that we've chosen and constraining ourselves to the core graphical design 
    principles that we've decided on, we write the code for our website. The following guideposts 
    will help our implementation to stay focused and organized:
       * Website implementation points of emphasis:
	       -Excellent content and good graphic design principles
	       -Intuitive, easy to use interface
	       -Identifiable branding and market value
	       -Clean, commented coding style
	       -Project compiled using separate branches and informative git commit messages
	       -Website works on top 3 browsers, Android and iOS
	       -Project employs customer centered design principles
       * Final Presentation points of emphasis:
	       -Working demo
	       -Description of goals and target market for the website
	       -Illustration of how the 5 centered design principles were addressed
	       -Each group member participates in the presentation
	       -Have a little section of the presentation that outlines each member's contributions
       * Individual Reflections emailed to Dr. Jones
