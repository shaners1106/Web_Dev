        Our side scroller game is the result of assimilating multiple visions into one fluid design.  We 
        were inspired by childhood memories of playing games like Super Mario Bros, Terarria and Google
        dinosaur games. While the technology behind modern video games has left games such as these in 
        the dust, revisiting the nostalgia of childhood when times were simpler is a goal that we hope
        you will experience playing our game.  So many of us have great memories of simple games like this,
        running, jumping, learning how to dodge imminent enemies.  We hope you enjoy playing our game and 
        on some level catch a glimpse into the past.</b>
