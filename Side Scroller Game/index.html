This HTML file contains the code for our website's home page

We did our best to accurately tab and space the HTML elements.  
Nested elements are all tabbed in 3 spaces.

Our website's main page features a body comprised of 3 primary
components: a top <section> that displays the name of our game
and links to our design and resource pages in a bordered element,
a middle <main> that features a screenshot of artwork from our 
side scroller game scenery, and a <footer> that features and 
invitation for website visitors to play our game.
