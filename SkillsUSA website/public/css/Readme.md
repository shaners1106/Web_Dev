# SkillsUSA CSS 

This directory contains the CSS assets that we used to design the SkillsUSA Computer Programming Challenge website.

## w3.css

This file contains the rules that were used to enhance the rest of the webpages of our website.  We heavily used a [CSS framework](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) as a foundation and added personalized elements from there.
